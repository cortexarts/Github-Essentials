- Add the GNU V3 license and the Unity ignore file to the repository
- Clone the git repository.
- Save your Unity project on your local repository.
- Enable External option in Unity → Preferences → Packages → Repository (only if Unity version is earlier older than 4.5).
- Switch to "Visible Meta Files" in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Version Control Mode.
- Switch to "Force Text" in Edit → Project Settings → Editor → Asset Serialization Mode.
- Save scene and project from the "File" menu.
- Exit Unity.
- Create a .gitignore file using the text in the .gitignore file from this repository.
